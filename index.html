        <h1>SCICT AT A GLANCE</h1>
        <p>SQI College of ICT offers both <span> National Diploma </span>and <span> Professional Certificate programmes.</span></p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The diploma Certificate conforms with the standard National Diploma Certificate obtained in Polytechnics while the Professional certificate is the certificate you earn after taking a professional course here at SQI.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            You can use the Diploma certificate to seek admissions into the University through Direct Entry or for Higher National Diploma (HND). While the professional Certificate is recognized worldwide not as a degree but as a proof of having undergone professional training in the field for which the certificate is issued.
